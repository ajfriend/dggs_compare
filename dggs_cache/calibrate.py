"""Match S2 / A5 / DGGAL resolutions to an H3-res-9 cell by area.

Picks, for each DGGS, the resolution whose median cell area is closest (in
log-ratio) to the reference H3 res-9 cell — the resolution baked into each
generator's TARGET (and survey.py) so all systems compare cells of roughly the
same size.

Reads the pre-generated cell sets (dggs_cache/cells/, `just gen-cells` first)
and measures area with `sparea` (spherical-polygon area). No skar, no DGGS
libraries — it runs natively off the Parquet rings. The cell sets span every
resolution, which is exactly the scan a calibration needs.

Adding a new DGGS: generate its cell sets, run this (it scans every cached
system across all resolutions automatically), then bake the pick into
_common.TARGET_RES.

Run with:  just calibrate   (or: uv run dggs_cache/calibrate.py)
No CLI args (project convention) — edit the constants below in place.
